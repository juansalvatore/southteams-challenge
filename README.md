Create a React app that allows the user to make a supermarket list.


- APP: https://southteams-challenge.netlify.com/
- STORYBOOK: https://southteams-challenge-storybook.netlify.com/

## How to run the project locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/juansalvatore/southteams-challenge.git`

2. `npm install`

3. `npm start`

## How to run the project locally
Steps 1 and 2 from above and: `npm run storybook`

## Technologies used

- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age ðŸ’…
- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Tool for developing UI components in isolation for React

## Specs:

The app has 3 sections:

- The item count (0)
- An "Add Item" button (1)
- A list of items (2)
- An item form within a modal (3)
- When user clicks (1) it must show a modal (3) with an item form. The item is just a plain string so a text input with a save and cancel button is enought. "Save" option must control that the input is not empty and add the item to the list and close modal. "Cancel" just close the modal.
- Each element of the list (2) display the item text and also has a button with the option "Remove". Clicking that button remove the item from the list.
- When the list is empty, it should show a "List is empty" message.
- It's not posible to edit items in this version just add and remove.

## Restrictions:

- It must be a project created with create-eact-app. App must run with just npm/yarn start.
- Use just plain react (no state manager library).
- Persist items in memory, but prepare the app structure to add server-side comunication when needed. (i.e.: You must have an api.js file that expose functions to get all items, to add an item and to remove an item. These functions must return promises but internally can just add and remove items from an array in memory or save in local storage. You can also use the npm package delay to emulate async)

## Styles

- Use flexbox and plain CSS preferently (\*).
- Try to implement the given design as similar as possible.

\*This means that can not use a UI library (like bootstrap) for this, but you can use a css preprocesor, css modules or styles-coponents if you like. Althought we recomend to just use the default configuration for styles that comes with create-react-app.

## Deploy

Use a service like https://zeit.co/now or https://surge.sh/ to deploy the app. Send us the url along with the github repo.
